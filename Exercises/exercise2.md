## Exercise: Validate a user's access to a secure facility

You are developing a simple authentication system for a secure facility.
The system needs to verify the identity of a person based on their credentials
The person is granted access only if they meet either of the following

## conditions:

1. They have a valid access code i.e. a 4-digit numerical code.
2. They are a member of the access list, which contains the following

members: 69, 420, 69420.
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter their access code and
check whether they are allowed access based on the conditions mentioned above.
Display a message indicating whether access is granted or denied.
