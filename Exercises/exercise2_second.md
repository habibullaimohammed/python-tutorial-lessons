## Exercise: Validate a user's age for accessing a restricted content

You are developing a Python program to validate a user's age for accessing a restricted content on a website. The program should prompt the user to enter their age and then determine whether they are allowed access based on the following conditions:

1. Users must be at least 18 years old to access the content.
2. Users who are between 13 and 17 years old must have parental consent to access the content.

Write a Python program that implements the above requirements and displays a message indicating whether access is granted or denied.

### Example:

Enter your age: 25
Access granted!

Enter your age: 16
You must have parental consent to access the content.

Enter your age: 10
Access denied.


Ensure your program handles various scenarios, including invalid input and edge cases.
