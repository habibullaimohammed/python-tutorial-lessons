Exercise 8:

Create a Python program that simulates a basic quiz. The quiz should consist of three multiple-choice questions, each with four options (A, B, C, D). The user should be prompted to answer each question, and at the end of the quiz, the program should display the user's score.

Here are the questions:

1. What is the capital of France? 
   - Ans: Paris

2. Which planet is known as the "Red Planet"?
   - Ans: Mars

3. What is the largest mammal on Earth?
   - Ans:
   
4. What is the largest planet in our solar system?
   - Ans: Jupiter

5. Who painted the Mona Lisa?
   - Ans: Leonardo da Vinci

Create a program `quiz` that handles the quiz logic. The program returns the user's score. Make sure to provide feedback on the correctness of each answer.

Here's a starter code to help you get started:

```Output example
Qustion 1: What is the capital of France
Your answer: Paris
Correct!

Qustion 2: What is the largest planet in our solar system?
Your answer: JupiteR
Correct!

Question 2: Who painted the Mona Lisa?
Your answer: An incorrect answer
Incorrect. The correct answer is Leonardo da Vinci

Your final score is 2 out of 3

```

This code provides a framework for the quiz, with questions, options, correct answers, and user input handling. You can modify or expand it as needed.
