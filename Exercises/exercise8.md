You find yourself managing two gyms, GymI and Gym2. Members are eager to
join or leave, and you need a program to keep things organized.

Create a program that allows you to add or remove members, 
display common members in both gyms, 
check if one gym is a subset or superset of the other,
display a combined list of all members, 
and find exclusive members in each gym
